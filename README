This program is tools to simplify the appearance of URLs written in
a buffer.  After evaluating `shorten-url-region' and
`shorten-url-narrow', try running `shorten-url-narrow' on the
following line.

https://example.com/hogehoge.whowhowho/EXAMPLE

The appearance of the URL changes as follows.

example.com/...XAMPLE

You can shorten all URLs in the current buffer with
`shorten-all-url-buffer'.  If you always want to shorten URLs in a
minor mode, add `shorten-all-url-buffer' to that minor mode hook.
